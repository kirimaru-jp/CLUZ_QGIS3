# CLUZ
CLUZ plugin for QGIS v3

CLUZ (Conservation Land-Use Zoning software) is a QGIS plug-in that allows users to design protected area networks
and other conservation landscapes and seascapes. It can be used for on-screen planning and also acts as a link for
the Marxan conservation planning software. It was developed by Bob Smith, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation
and Ecology (DICE), and funded by the UK Government's Darwin Initiative.
